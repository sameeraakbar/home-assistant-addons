# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Autossh

## About

Use SSH to make your local Home Assistant setup available at and through a remote system.
This forms yet another way to make the Lovelace UI and other services accessible from other networks or the public internet.

This add-on is only useful to those with access to a publicly available SSH server and some administrative privileges on that system.
